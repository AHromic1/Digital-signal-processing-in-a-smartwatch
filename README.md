# Digital-signal-processing-in-a-smartwatch

This repository is created in order to demonstrate the results of my research within the course Digital Signal Processing. 

The aim of this project is to use data obtained from the sensors fo a smartwatch in order to draw conclusions about the user's activities by applying the right algorithms: whether the user is running, sitting, swimming and in which style, etc. 

This is the project which is currently in progress, and this repository will be updated accordingly, as a reflection of my work.
